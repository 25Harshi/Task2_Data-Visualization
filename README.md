 Step 1: Import Data into Power BI
Open Power BI and click "Get Data."

Choose CSV file format and select Superstore.csv.

Click Load to import the dataset.

Step 2: Clean & Transform Data (Power Query)
Open Power Query Editor and check for:

Missing values

Incorrect data types (e.g., numbers formatted as text)

Duplicate entries

Apply necessary filters, rename columns, and remove unnecessary fields.

ðŸ”¹ Example from your dashboard: You have filters for Year and Region, ensuring focused analysis.

Step 3: Create Relationships Between Tables
If your dataset has multiple tables (e.g., Orders, Customers, Products):

Navigate to Model View and define relationships (one-to-many).

This ensures proper data aggregation in charts.

Step 4: Build Key Visualizations
Use Bar Charts for Sales Comparison by Category.

Use Line Charts for Profit Trends over months.

Use Map Visualizations for Geographical Sales Distribution.

ðŸ”¹ Example from your dashboard:

Sales & Profit Margin by Month (Line Chart)

Quantity by Category (Bar Chart)

Sales by Country & Category (Map)

Step 5: Add Business Insights & Storytelling
Highlight key trends with colors (Green for positive growth, Red for decline).

Use tooltips & labels to explain insights (e.g., "Profit declined in Q2 due to high discounts").

Add interactive filters to allow users to drill down into specific data.

ðŸ”¹ Your dashboardâ€™s reference: You used interactive slicers for filtering by Year and Region.

Step 6: Create Summary Slide (Dashboard Overview)
Design a clear overview page with key metrics like:

Total Sales, Profit, Performance Trends

Ensure each section answers a business question like:

"Which category performs the best?"

"Which region contributes the most sales?"

ðŸ”¹ Your dashboardâ€™s reference: You have tabs labeled "Overview," "Profit," "Performance," "Product Details" for structured storytelling.

Step 7: Export & Deliver
Save your final report as Power BI screenshot.
